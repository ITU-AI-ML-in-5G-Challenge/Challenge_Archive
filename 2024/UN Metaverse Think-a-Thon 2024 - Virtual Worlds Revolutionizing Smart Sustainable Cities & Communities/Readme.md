## Overview

As defined by the ITU Focus Group on metaverse, the metaverse is “an integrative ecosystem of virtual worlds offering immersive experiences to users, that modify pre-existing and create new value from economic, environmental, social and cultural perspectives.” The metaverse is a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality, including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the internet.

The metaverse is no longer fictional; it’s a ground for innovation, collaboration, and action. As we navigate the intricate pathways of this digital universe, we aim to unlock its full potential in addressing pressing global challenges and advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Metaverse Think-a-Thon 2024 aims to harness the potential of virtual technologies and innovative approaches to generate actionable insights, propose practical solutions, and foster a collective vision for creating smarter, more sustainable cities and communities.

## Theme

This year’s Metaverse Think-a-Thon theme is on **Virtual Worlds Revolutionizing Smart Sustainable Cities & Communities**.

## Key Objectives

* Explore the intersection of virtual technologies and sustainable development to catalyze innovative solutions for smart cities and communities.
* Foster interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge exchange among experts and innovators in the fields of technology, sustainability, urban planning, engineering, and more.
* Co-create actionable strategies and initiatives to harness the metaverse’s capabilities in addressing critical challenges, from education and disaster preparedness to sustainability and beyond.

## Proposed Sub-topics

* **Virtual Education Platforms**: Creating immersive virtual learning environments to improve access to education for underserved communities, promoting lifelong learning opportunities (SDG 4: Quality Education).
* **Disaster Preparedness and Response**: Propose virtual simulations and training environments to train emergency responders and communities for natural and man-made disaster preparedness and response (SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 13: Climate Action).
* **Urban Conflict Resolution Simulations**: Conduct virtual simulations tailored for urban and city management to facilitate diplomatic negotiations and resolve conflicts between cities, communities, stakeholders, and urban planners. These simulations aim to enhance conflict analysis and peacebuilding strategies for urban areas (SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).

## Participation

The Metaverse Think-a-Thon 2024 presents an exciting platform for collaboration and innovation, welcoming students (current or recent graduates) from diverse academic backgrounds and accredited Universities worldwide to join forces in shaping the future of our cities and communities. They will collaborate, brainstorm, design, and prototype solutions addressing the proposed sub-topics.

Participation is open to:

* Students, whether currently enrolled or recent graduates, are encouraged to participate either individually or in teams.
* Teams should comprise a minimum of 3 individuals and a maximum of 5.
* And is free of charge.
