# GeoAI Amazon Basin Secret Runway Detection Challenge by ITU

## Can you detect illegal runways in the Peruvian Amazonian basin?

Original on Zindi: https://zindi.africa/competitions/geoai-amazon-basin-secret-runway-detection-challenge

Clandestine runways, often covertly constructed in remote regions, serve as pivotal infrastructure for various illicit activities, notably illegal logging, mining, and narcotics trafficking. These runways, enable the swift and undetected movement of goods and personnel, circumventing governmental and international regulations designed to protect the Amazon and its indigenous communities.

The construction and operation of these runways have profound implications for both security and environmental sustainability. From a security perspective, clandestine runways facilitate organized crime by providing logistical support for drug cartels and illegal mining operations. These activities undermine the rule of law, contribute to regional instability, and pose direct threats to the safety of local populations. The ability of criminal networks to operate with impunity in these remote areas is bolstered by the lack of monitoring and enforcement capabilities, exacerbating the cycle of violence and corruption.

Environmentally, the existence of clandestine runways accelerates the degradation of the Amazon rainforest. The construction of these runways necessitates the clearing of large tracts of forest, leading to habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity. The associated illegal activities, such as unregulated mining and logging, further compound this damage. For instance, illegal mining often involves the use of toxic chemicals like mercury, which can contaminate water sources and soil, affecting both wildlife and human health. Moreover, the deforestation linked to these runways contributes to climate change by reducing the Amazon's capacity to sequester carbon dioxide.

Addressing the issue of clandestine runways requires a multifaceted approach, combining advanced technological surveillance, robust legal frameworks, and enhanced international cooperation. Remote sensing technologies, such as satellite imagery and aerial reconnaissance, play a crucial role in detecting and monitoring these illicit infrastructures. By leveraging such technologies, authorities can disrupt the operations of criminal networks, mitigate environmental destruction, and uphold the integrity of the Amazon rainforest. Collaborative efforts among governments, NGOs, and local communities are essential to develop sustainable solutions that safeguard both the security and environmental health of this vital region.

UNODC is currently carrying out research on spatial distribution and impact of clandestine airways. Available datasets derive from visual interpretation of satellite imagery.

In the realm of geospatial research, the automated identification and analysis of clandestine runways present intriguing challenges. Our proposal explores this domain, aiming to pioneer automated techniques for detecting and analyzing clandestine runways using satellite imagery and machine learning algorithms. By leveraging state-of-the-art technologies, we seek to contribute to the advancement of remote sensing capabilities and geospatial analysis methodologies.

Beyond the security, our research holds promise for diverse applications in environmental monitoring, land management, and urban planning. The automated detection of clandestine runways can provide valuable insights into land use changes, ecological disruptions, and illicit activities, contributing to a deeper understanding of human-environment interactions.

The objectives of this competition are to develop methods for automated detection of clandestine runways on open source medium resolution imagery (both optical and radar) and to comparethe performance of several methods and assess how the integration of optical and SAR data increases the model accuracy.

### Rules

<b>You may only use the dataset for this competition, after completion of the challenge you must delete all records of this data.</b>

This challenge is open to all.

#### Teams and collaboration

You may participate in challenges as an individual or in a team of up to four people. When creating a team, the team must have a total submission count less than or equal to the maximum allowable submissions as of the formation date. A team will be allowed the maximum number of submissions for the challenge, minus the total number of submissions among team members at team formation. Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Multiple accounts per user are not permitted, and neither is collaboration or membership across multiple teams. Individuals and their submissions originating from multiple accounts will be immediately disqualified from the platform.

Code must not be shared privately outside of a team. Any code that is shared, must be made available to all challenge participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).

The Zindi data scientist who sets up a team is the default Team Leader but they can transfer leadership to another data scientist on the team. The Team Leader can invite other data scientists to their team. Invited data scientists can accept or reject invitations. Until a second data scientist accepts an invitation to join a team, the data scientist who initiated a team remains an individual on the leaderboard. No additional members may be added to teams within the final 5 days of the challenge or last hour of a hackathon.

The team leader can initiate a merge with another team. Only the team leader of the second team can accept the invite. The default team leader is the leader from the team who initiated the invite. Teams can only merge if the total number of members is less than or equal to the maximum team size of the challenge.

A team can be disbanded if it has not yet made a submission. Once a submission is made individual members cannot leave the team.

All members in the team receive points associated with their ranking in the challenge and there is no split or division of the points between team members.

#### Datasets and packages

The solution must use publicly-available, open-source packages only.

If the challenge is a computer vision challenge, image metadata (Image size, aspect ratio, pixel count, etc) may not be used in your submission.

You may use only the datasets provided for this competition. Automated machine learning tools such as automl are not permitted.

#### You may use pretrained models as long as they are openly available to everyone.

You may only use the dataset for this competition, after completion of the challenge you must delete all records of this data.

You must notify Zindi immediately upon learning of any unauthorised transmission of or unauthorised access to the competition data, and work with Zindi to rectify any unauthorised transmission or access.

Your solution must not infringe the rights of any third party and you must be legally entitled to assign ownership of all rights of copyright in and to the winning solution code to Zindi.

#### Submissions and winning

You may make a maximum of 10 submissions per day.

You may make a maximum of 200 submissions for this competition.

Before the end of the competition you need to choose 2 submissions to be judged on for the private leaderboard. If you do not make a selection your 2 best public leaderboard submissions will be used to score on the private leaderboard.

During the competition, your best public score will be displayed regardless of the submissions you have selected. When the competition closes your best private score out of the 2 selected submissions will be displayed.

Zindi maintains a public leaderboard and a private leaderboard for each competition. The Public Leaderboard includes approximately 20% of the test dataset. While the competition is open, the Public Leaderboard will rank the submitted solutions by the accuracy score they achieve. Upon close of the competition, the Private Leaderboard, which covers the other 80% of the test dataset, will be made public and will constitute the final ranking for the competition.

Note that to count, your submission must first pass processing. If your submission fails during the processing step, it will not be counted and not receive a score; nor will it count against your daily submission limit. If you encounter problems with your submission file, your best course of action is to ask for advice on the Competition’s discussion forum.

If you are in the top 10 at the time the leaderboard closes, we will email you to request your code. On receipt of email, you will have 48 hours to respond and submit your code following the Reproducibility of submitted code guidelines detailed below. Failure to respond will result in disqualification.

If your solution places 1st, 2nd, or 3rd on the final leaderboard, you will be required to submit your winning solution code to us for verification, and you thereby agree to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.

If two solutions earn identical scores on the leaderboard, the tiebreaker will be the date and time in which the submission was made (the earlier solution will win).

The winners will be paid via bank transfer, PayPal if payment is less than or equivalent to $100, or other international money transfer platform. International transfer fees will be deducted from the total prize amount, unless the prize money is under $500, in which case the international transfer fees will be covered by Zindi. In all cases, the winners are responsible for any other fees applied by their own bank or other institution for receiving the prize money. All taxes imposed on prizes are the sole responsibility of the winners. The top winners or team leaders will be required to present Zindi with proof of identification, proof of residence and a letter from your bank confirming your banking details. Winners will be paid in USD or the currency of the competition. If your account cannot receive US Dollars or the currency of the competition then your bank will need to provide proof of this and Zindi will try to accommodate this.

Payment will be made after code review and sealing the leaderboard.
