# Caribbean Voices AI Hackathon by UWI AI Innovation Centre

## Can you train an automatic speech recognition model for Caribbean accents?


Link to Zindi: https://zindi.africa/competitions/caribbean-voices-hackathon

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems like Whisper and others have transformed how we interact with technology — yet they regularly fail for Caribbean accents. This challenge invites data scientists, AI builders, and machine learning engineers from the Caribbean to help close that gap.

You’ll be working with a unique dataset of 28,000 thirty-second audio clips from BBC Caribbean, each manually transcribed. Your goal is to develop or fine-tune an ASR model that best predicts the transcribed text from the audio clips.

The top 5 participants on the final leaderboard will be invited to pitch an innovative application of their ASR model — showing how speech recognition for Caribbean languages could drive social and economic inclusion.

ASR models that perform well on Caribbean voices can open doors to inclusion in education, financial services, agriculture, and digital communication, empowering people and organisations across the region to access and create content in their own language.

### Competition Structure

#### Phase 1 (14 Nov - 7 Dec): Modelling Round

Develop an ASR model that can accurately transcribe audio clips. Submissions will be evaluated on transcription accuracy using the Word Error Rate (WER) metric.

#### Phase 2 ( 8 - 13 Dec): Innovation Round

The top 10 teams on the final leaderboard of Phase 1 (revealed after the challenge closes) will be invited to submit a 3-minute pitch for an impactful application of their ASR model in the Caribbean. Pitch videos must be submitted by 11:59pm AST on 9 December. Pitches can be a demo of a prototype app or slide deck presentation. The top 3 pitches will be selected (and notified by 11 December) to pitch live (virtually or in-person) to the judges at the official launch of the AI Innovation Center at UWI St. Augustine in Trinidad on 13 December 2025.

Your ideas for using the ASR model could address one or more of the following areas:

- Agriculture – e.g., voice-based tools for farmers, language-inclusive knowledge platforms.
- Financial Inclusion – e.g., voice-enabled banking or customer support systems that understand local accents.
- Social Inclusion – e.g., cultural preservation through digital media.
- Marginalized Communities – e.g., accessibility tools, subtitling and captioning for Caribbean content, services for the visually impaired or low literacy communities
- GovTech – e.g., voice-activated public services provided over telephone
You will have 3 minutes to present, and the pitch must be in English. It can incorporate a demo if you have one, but this is not a requirement of the challenge.

This means, if you believe you will be in the top 10 on the PRIVATE leaderboard at the end of the Phase 1, start preparing your concept and pitch.

The top three pitches will be judged live on 13 December, on the criteria of innovation, impact, and feasibility. <b>NB: This challenge is only open to users residing in CARICOM countries (see Eligibility section for full details). Winners will be expected to demonstrate proof of residence or nationality.</b>



### Evaluation
This challenge will be evaluated in two phases:

- Phase 1 winners and leaderboard position will be determined by Word Error Rate (WER) between your predicted transcriptions and the human transcription.
- Phase 2 finalists and winners will be decided based on a panel of judges of the pitch submissions, based on the evaluation rubric below.
The top ten participants in Phase 1 will be asked to submit a pitch in Phase 2.

#### Phase 1: Word Error Rate
In the first round, submissions will be evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER) between your predicted transcriptions and the human transcription.

For every row in the dataset, submission files should contain 2 columns: ID and Sranslation.

Your submission file should look like this:

| ID        | Transcription        |
|-----------|----------------------|
| ID_IJLHYZ | Lucia Labour Party... |
| ID_OFIPGR | Mrs. Trieu made...    |

#### Phase 2: Notebook and Documentation Evaluation

The top 3 shortlisted teams’ pitches will be evaluated by a panel of judges on 13 December, based on the following evaluation criteria:

- Innovation (40%) – Originality and creativity of the idea.
- Impact (40%) – Potential to drive social or economic inclusion.
- Feasibility (20%) – Practicality of implementation.





### Prizes

#### Phase 1:

1st prize: $2500

2nd prize: $1500

3rd prize: $1000

#### Phase 2:

$2500 for the winning pitch

Proof of residence must be provided for payment to be made.

### Full Challenge Rules

<b>B: This challenge is only open to users residing in CARICOM countries (see Eligibility section for full details). Winners will be expected to demonstrate proof of residence or nationality.</b>

#### Teams and collaboration

You may participate in challenges as an individual or in a team of up to four people. When creating a team, the team must have a total submission count less than or equal to the maximum allowable submissions as of the formation date. A team will be allowed the maximum number of submissions for the challenge, minus the total number of submissions among team members at team formation. Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Multiple accounts per user are not permitted, and neither is collaboration or membership across multiple teams. Individuals and their submissions originating from multiple accounts will be immediately disqualified from the platform.

Code must not be shared privately outside of a team. Any code that is shared, must be made available to all challenge participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).

The Zindi data scientist who sets up a team is the default Team Leader but they can transfer leadership to another data scientist on the team. The Team Leader can invite other data scientists to their team. Invited data scientists can accept or reject invitations. Until a second data scientist accepts an invitation to join a team, the data scientist who initiated a team remains an individual on the leaderboard. No additional members may be added to teams within the final 5 days of the challenge or last hour of a hackathon.

The team leader can initiate a merge with another team. Only the team leader of the second team can accept the invite. The default team leader is the leader from the team who initiated the invite. Teams can only merge if the total number of members is less than or equal to the maximum team size of the challenge.

A team can be disbanded if it has not yet made a submission. Once a submission is made individual members cannot leave the team.

All members in the team receive points associated with their ranking in the challenge and there is no split or division of the points between team members.


#### Datasets, packages and general principles

The solution must use publicly-available, open-source packages only.

You may use only the datasets provided for this challenge.

You may use pretrained models as long as they are openly available to everyone.

Automated machine learning tools such as automl are not permitted.

If the error metric requires probabilities to be submitted, do not set thresholds (or round your probabilities) to improve your place on the leaderboard. In order to ensure that the client receives the best solution Zindi will need the raw probabilities. This will allow the clients to set thresholds to their own needs.

You are allowed to access, use and share challenge data for any commercial, non-commercial, research or education purposes, under a CC-BY SA 4.0 license.

You must notify Zindi immediately upon learning of any unauthorised transmission of or unauthorised access to the challenge data, and work with Zindi to rectify any unauthorised transmission or access.

Your solution must not infringe the rights of any third party and you must be legally entitled to assign ownership of all rights of copyright in and to the winning solution code to Zindi.

#### Submissions and winning

You may make a maximum of 10 submissions per day.

You may make a maximum of 300 submissions for this challenge.

Before the end of the challenge you need to choose 2 submissions to be judged on for the private leaderboard. If you do not make a selection your 2 best public leaderboard submissions will be used to score on the private leaderboard.

During the challenge, your best public score will be displayed regardless of the submissions you have selected. When the challenge closes your best private score out of the 2 selected submissions will be displayed.

Zindi maintains a public leaderboard and a private leaderboard for each challenge. The Public Leaderboard includes approximately 30% of the test dataset. While the challenge is open, the Public Leaderboard will rank the submitted solutions by the accuracy score they achieve. Upon close of the challenge, the Private Leaderboard, which covers the other 70% of the test dataset, will be made public and will constitute the final ranking for the challenge.

Note that to count, your submission must first pass processing. If your submission fails during the processing step, it will not be counted and not receive a score; nor will it count against your daily submission limit. If you encounter problems with your submission file, your best course of action is to ask for advice on the challenge page.

If you are in the top 10 at the time the leaderboard closes, we will email you to request your code. On receipt of email, you will have 48 hours to respond and submit your code following the Reproducibility of submitted code guidelines detailed below. Failure to respond will result in disqualification.

If your solution places 1st, 2nd, or 3rd on the final leaderboard, you will be required to submit your winning solution code to us for verification, and you thereby agree to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.

If two solutions earn identical scores on the leaderboard, the tiebreaker will be the date and time in which the submission was made (the earlier solution will win).

The winners will be paid via bank transfer, PayPal if payment is less than or equivalent to $100, or other international money transfer platform. International transfer fees will be deducted from the total prize amount, unless the prize money is under $500, in which case the international transfer fees will be covered by Zindi. In all cases, the winners are responsible for any other fees applied by their own bank or other institution for receiving the prize money. All taxes imposed on prizes are the sole responsibility of the winners. The top winners or team leaders will be required to present Zindi with proof of identification, proof of residence and a letter from your bank confirming your banking details. Winners will be paid in USD or the currency of the challenge. If your account cannot receive US Dollars or the currency of the challenge then your bank will need to provide proof of this and Zindi will try to accommodate this.

Please note that due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, we are not currently able to make prize payments to winners located in Russia. We apologise for any inconvenience that may cause, and will handle any issues that arise on a case-by-case basis.

Payment will be made after code review and sealing the leaderboard.
