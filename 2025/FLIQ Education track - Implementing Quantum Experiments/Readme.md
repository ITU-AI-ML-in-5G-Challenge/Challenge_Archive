# FLIQ Education Track - Quantum Demonstrations: Bringing Theory to Life

## Overview

Step into the shoes of a quantum scientist and bring foundational quantum phenomena to life. Whether you’re simulating iconic experiments, constructing entangled states, or crafting novel quantum gadgets like dice and random number generators, this challenge invites you to build, test, and explain core quantum mechanics using quantum circuits. Ideal for those ready to transform theory into interactive, code-driven demonstrations of quantum behavior.

## Challenge Details

### Challenge Statement

In this challenge, your task is to design a step-by-step Jupyter Notebook that teaches a foundational quantum experiment in an intuitive and engaging way. You’ll explain the theory behind the experiment, build up the quantum circuit using Qiskit, and demonstrate how to run the circuit on IBM’s quantum devices. You may choose from suggested experiments (e.g., quantum random number generation, Bell state creation, quantum dice, or the double-slit experiment) or propose your own.

At least one component of your tutorial should run on real quantum hardware. Include visual aids such as circuit diagrams or output histograms, and guide users through both the conceptual and practical steps. Aim to create a self-contained tutorial that balances clarity, interactivity, and technical accuracy.

### Github Repositories

You may use Qiskit starter code, example ideas, and installation tools provided here:
[https://github.com/quantamu/qtamu-ibm-fliq-challenge](https://github.com/quantamu/qtamu-ibm-fliq-challenge)

## Evaluation Criteria

* **Clarity and accessibility of the tutorial**
* **Correctness and execution on real hardware**
* **Use of helpful visualizations and step-by-step structure**
* **Creativity** in the choice and presentation of the experiment
* In the case of a tie, **educational strength and interactivity** will decide.

## Submission

Your submission must be a GitHub repository containing:

* A Jupyter Notebook tutorial with:
    * Clear, beginner-friendly explanations
    * Executable Qiskit code (including at least one job sent to IBM hardware)
    * Visualizations and results
* A `README` with instructions for local setup
* **OPTIONAL**: local test script (`.py`) for circuit correctness
* **OPTIONAL**: short demo video or presentation
