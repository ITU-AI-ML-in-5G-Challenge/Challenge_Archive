# FLIQ Innovation Track - Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning for Responsible AI

## Overview

Participants will apply **quantum machine learning** to distinguish between different phases of a Rydberg atom system using measurement data obtained in randomized bases.

This challenge is part of the **Innovation Track** whose aim is to encourage the exploration of cross-disciplinary applications that leverage quantum computing to drive social impact and demonstrate the transformative potential of quantum technologies.

### Difficulty Level

Intermediate to Advanced

## Challenge Details

### Challenge Statement

In this challenge, participants will **enhance an AI/ML classifier or clusterer using Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs)**.

You will be provided with:
* A set of public datasets
* Starter code in the repository

Your mission: **Finish and innovate on the starter code** (or create your own approach) to develop quantum-enhanced machine learning models that meet the evaluation standards.

**Focus Areas:** Performance, explainability, fairness, security, robustness, and innovation.

### GitHub Repository

Challenge Repo: [https://github.com/UN-ICC/FLIQ-Virtual-Hackathon](https://github.com/UN-ICC/FLIQ-Virtual-Hackathon)

### Sample Code

Our sample code for a VQA classifier will be available in the GitHub Repository.
Use them as a foundation or as inspiration but donâ€™t be afraid to innovate or try your own unique solution.

Keep in mind you will need to be using an environment capable of running `torch` or a similar ML library and `qiskit`. Additionally, as of 2025, `qiskit` has just moved to 2.x.x, meaning deprecated code is common and documentation/functionality can differ between versions.

### Datasets

Some datasets have been provided but feel free to propose additional datasets and justifications if so.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Category                      | Description                                                                    |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance Evaluation** | Measure Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy; balance false positives and negatives. |
| **Fairness & Bias Detection** | Evaluate demographic fairness using metrics like Disparate Impact Ratio.         |
| **Adversarial Robustness Testing** | Test resilience against manipulated/adversarial inputs.                         |
| **Explainability & Interpretability Testing** | Provide understandable model decisions (e.g., SHAP, LIME, Counterfactuals). |
| **Privacy & Security Compliance** | Ensure data encryption, anonymization, GDPR/ISO compliance.                   |
| **Operational Reliability & Governance** | Maintain model stability, version control, governance for compliance.      |
| **Human-in-the-Loop Validation** | Allow human oversight: reviewing, overriding, validating AI outputs.             |
| **Innovation & Uniqueness** | Creativity and originality of your quantum-classical hybrid model.             |
| **Implementation Quality** | Code quality, structure, and efficiency.                                       |
| **Presentation & Understanding** | Clear explanation of approach, trade-offs, and insights.                       |



# Submission

Your submission must contain the code you used to train your model, model weights and a demo script if applicable (.pt files or similar is great), a write-up describing what you did and how you did it, and optionally a short video demo and presentation.

You are not required to use the sample code provided but please make a **public fork of the repository** for your submission.

Feel free to try any combination of classification, clustering, supervised/unsupervised learning, unique backpropagation techniques, quantum circuit designs, etc.
