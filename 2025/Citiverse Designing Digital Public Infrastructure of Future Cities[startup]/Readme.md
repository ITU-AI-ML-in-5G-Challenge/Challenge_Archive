# 1st UN Citiverse Challenge

## Description

The **1st UN Citiverse Challenge** invites **students** and **startups** to imagine and design innovative solutions that leverage the transformative potential of the **citiverse** and **digital public infrastructure** to address pressing global challenges. By focusing on three critical themes—access to public services, sustainability and resilience, and tourism and digital culture—participants will develop bold ideas and prototypes to shape the cities of tomorrow.

The UN Citiverse Challenge is directly aligned with the vision of the **Pact for the Future** and the principles of the **Global Digital Compact (GDC)**, emphasizing inclusive, sustainable, and equitable approaches to digital transformation. Participants have the opportunity to lead the way in advancing the GDC’s goals by exploring how cutting-edge technologies and human creativity can foster a more connected and resilient world.

This challenge champions a transformative approach to urban innovation, harnessing digital public infrastructure alongside technologies such as AI, metaverse immersive environments, digital twins, IoT, and open-source solutions to reimagine cities as inclusive, engaging, resilient, and sustainable hubs of progress for its citizens and e-citizens.

### Key Themes:

* **Access to Public Services**: Redesign digital identity and financial systems to empower underserved populations, ensuring inclusivity and equity.
* **Sustainability and Resilience**: Develop open, interoperable digital infrastructure to enhance energy access, optimize resources, and improve climate adaptation and disaster preparedness.
* **Tourism and Digital Culture**: Create solutions that preserve cultural heritage, enhance accessibility, and foster immersive, inclusive cultural experiences.

# Problem Statements

Participants will tackle real-world challenges directly linked to the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** and global priorities:

* **Access to Public Services (SDG 1 & SDG 11)**: Over 850 million people lack official identification, and 1.4 billion are unbanked, significantly limiting their access to essential services. The citiverse and digital public infrastructure can empower these individuals through inclusive, interoperable digital identity and financial systems.

* **Sustainability and Resilience (SDG 7 & SDG 13)**: Nearly half the world lacks reliable power, while climate-related disasters drive displacement and resource strain. Digital public infrastructure within the citiverse has the potential to strengthen climate adaptation efforts, optimize resource usage, and enhance energy access.

* **Tourism and Digital Culture (SDG 9 & SDG 11)**: Cultural heritage faces ongoing risks of misrepresentation, limited access, and inequitable preservation. The citiverse offers a transformative opportunity to safeguard cultural assets, foster inclusive tourism, and deliver immersive, authentic experiences, ensuring no one is left behind.
