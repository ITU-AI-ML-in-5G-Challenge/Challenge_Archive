## Introduction

The AI for [Early Warnings for All](https://earlywarningsforall.org/site/early-warnings-all) Innovation Challenge: Bridging Gaps with AI solutions is a global hackathon challenge hosted by the [AI Sub-Group of the EW4All initiative](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Emergency-Telecommunications/Pages/AI-Sub-Group-EW4All-.aspx). It is designed to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to address critical gaps in early warning systems (EWS) for disasters and extreme weather events. We are looking for projects that can contribute to:

* Improving data collection and analysis (**Data Gaps**)
* Enhancing the accuracy and reach of hazard forecasting (**Forecasting**)
* Addressing the societal implications of AI in early warning (**AI Effects on Society**)
* Optimizing emergency preparedness and resource allocation (**Emergency Preparedness & Resource Optimization**)

This global challenge was officially launched on **12 May 2025**. The registration and submission of solutions were officially open from **12 to 26 May 2025, 11:59 PM CEST**. The virtual challenge welcomed students, researchers, and innovators worldwide to tackle one of the most urgent challenges of our time: ensuring that everyone, everywhere is protected by early warning systems. It presents a great chance to bridge real-world gaps in disaster risk reduction using AI technologies.

Join forces with leading institutions and fellow changemakers to co-create scalable solutions across the four pillars of the [Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative](https://earlywarningsforall.org/site/early-warnings-all):

## Overview

As outlined by the UN Secretary-General’s [Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative](https://earlywarningsforall.org/), Early Warning Systems (EWS) are essential tools for reducing disaster risks and saving lives. However, critical gaps remain in data availability, forecasting accuracy, communication reach, and preparedness—particularly in vulnerable regions. The AI4Good EW4All Innovation Challenge is designed to address these challenges by applying artificial intelligence (AI) across all four EW4All pillars.

By aligning AI-driven solutions with the EW4All pillars, this challenge not only supports the EW4All initiative’s goal of protecting every person with an early warning system by 2027 but also fosters a collaborative approach to enabling greater disaster preparedness and response.

The AI for Early Warnings for All Innovation Challenge: Bridging Gaps with AI Solutions aims to harness the potential of AI to develop scalable, ethical, and impactful solutions that protect lives and strengthen global disaster resilience. By mobilizing a diverse community of innovators, the challenge fosters collaboration across disciplines to co-create technologies that build a safer, more prepared, and more equitable future for all.
