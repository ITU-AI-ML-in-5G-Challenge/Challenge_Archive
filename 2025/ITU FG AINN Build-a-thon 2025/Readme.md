![fig](2025051409164465897.png)
## Description

### Background

The ITU FG AINN Build-a-thon 2025 aims to develop designs and demonstrations to study key concepts discussed within the Focus Group (FG). The Build-a-thon will document and showcase the feasibility and considerations of these key concepts using currently available design and implementation approaches.

The broad objectives of the Build-a-thon are:

* **Analyze AI Native Use Cases**: Analyze AI Native for telecommunication networks use cases, requirements, and foster awareness on the FG activities.
* **Derive New Contributions**: Derive new contributions for the FG-AINN in the areas of:
    * Standardization Gaps
    * Use Cases
    * Architectures
    * Proofs of Concept (PoCs)
* **Explore Practical Feasibility**: Explore practical feasibility and trade-offs of AI-native networks via PoCs for specific use cases and architecture concepts.
* **Facilitate Hands-on Engagement**: Facilitate hands-on engagement through crowd-sourced coding and development activities.
* **Engage Stakeholders**: Engage stakeholders in discussions and collaborations to advance AI-native networks, especially a crowd-sourced coding activity involving academia, industry, and startups.

### Participation Stages

Participation in the Build-a-thon is divided into the following stages:

* **Stage-1. Demo Proposals**: These are proposals that clearly explain the chosen concept for demonstration, its relation with AI Native networks, including alternatives and trade-offs for studying and implementing them. Background study supporting the proposal should be added, and hypotheses on the target conclusions, based on currently ongoing studies in the domain of AI Native Networks, can be clearly mentioned in the proposal.
* **Stage-2. Implementation Proposals**: These are proposals that clearly explain the implementation approaches in detail, including the test setup, base code to be used (if any), mapped to the demo proposal from Stage 1. Functional and performance requirements corresponding to the demo, any datasets needed, toolsets (including open-source or proprietary), and test cases that correspond to requirements need to be added at this stage.
* **Stage-3. Initial Implementation of the Demo**: These implementations actualize parts of the implementation proposal from Stage 2. The initial implementation may not be complete nor final, but clearly shows progress towards completion. The pass/fail status of the test cases from Stage 2 shall be added in the submission. A plan towards the final demo would be added in relation to the current status of the initial implementation.
* **Stage-4. Final Demo and Report**: A contribution in the template of FG AINN, collating the relevant items from Stages 1, 2, and 3 above, specially highlighting the lessons learned on the feasibility of the design and that of the chosen implementation approach. A demo presentation showcasing the test cases and their results.

### Online Mentoring Sessions
