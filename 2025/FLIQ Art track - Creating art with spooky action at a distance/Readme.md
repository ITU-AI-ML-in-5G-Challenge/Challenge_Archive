# FLIQ Art track - Creating art with spooky action at a distance

## Overview

Entanglement — the phenomenon of complex correlations between objects that are separated in space—is one of the most powerful tools in the quantum computing toolbox. In this challenge, you will explore how entangled quantum memory can be combined with data encoding algorithms to produce art that transcends classical boundaries. Your goal is to craft visual or audio outputs that harness these non-classical correlations—creating works that are not just beautiful, but fundamentally quantum in nature.

This challenge is part of the **Art Track** whose aim is to encourage the exploration of cross-disciplinary applications that leverage quantum computing to drive social impact and demonstrate the transformative potential of quantum technologies.

### Difficulty Level

Advanced

## Challenge Statement

In this challenge, we would like you to extend the **QPIXL algorithm** to combine the running of an interesting algorithm and making it interact with the QRAM register so that you can entangle QPIXL with another algorithm. This other algorithm could be another instance of QPIXL itself so that you can entangle two images together, for example. You can either work with visual or audio files. The submission can either be code that is used programmatically or to have it embedded as a plugin for another tool.

You will be judged on the usability of your code, so consider making the code as general as possible if your submission is programmatic in nature (code to be used in a programmatic workflow). However, if the submission is that of a plugin (think like a post-processing effect in a DAW/image filter or a brush plugin for Photoshop/GIMP), then ease of use is more important than the flexibility of the code.

### Github Repositories

## Evaluation Criteria

* **Quality of the sample outputs**
* **Flexibility of the code**: How well the code is able to deal with inputs of varying sizes and circuits of different depths.
* **Usability**: In the case of a plugin-type submission.
* **Creativity of the implementation**
* **In the case of a tie**: Ease of use.

## Submission

Your submission must contain all your code and everything needed to run it. Give demonstration inputs (if needed) to run the code with, and give examples of the resulting outputs. Additionally, please provide a write-up explaining what exactly you/your team did.

Your submission should contain the following:
* All code
* Demonstration inputs and outputs (if needed)
* A write-up describing what you did and how you did it
* **OPTIONALLY** a short video demo and presentation
