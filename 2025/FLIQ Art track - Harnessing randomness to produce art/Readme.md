# FLIQ Art Track - Quantum Creativity: Generating Art with Quantum Devices

## Overview

Quantum computing is not just for search and optimization — it may also be a canvas for creative expression. In this artistic challenge, you will explore how data encoding and probabilistic quantum transformations can be used to generate art and imagery. Your task is to push the boundaries of what quantum devices can produce — where the logic of quantum randomness meets the spark of imagination.

This challenge is part of the **Art Track** whose aim is to encourage the exploration of cross-disciplinary applications that leverage quantum computing to drive social impact and demonstrate the transformative potential of quantum technologies.

## Challenge Details

### Challenge Statement

In this challenge, you will use the **QPIXL** or **QuantumBlur** algorithm for a creative project of your choice.

Consider modifying the circuit in small ways or embedding it into a larger creative work. The goal of this challenge is to think creatively using quantum tools instead of classical tools.

This could take the form of using the algorithm to modify images, of which there are some basic examples in the repository, or by using it to alter different data, like that of music, which will require some creative thinking. Perhaps you can think of a way to make it work without any input media and see what interesting things you can do with the circuit structure?

### Github Repositories

Please find the algorithms we would like you to use along with examples in the repositories below.

* **QPIXL algorithm** (with a fantastic README for FLIQ): [https://github.com/HeidelbergQuantum/QPIXL_ITU-2025](https://github.com/HeidelbergQuantum/QPIXL_ITU-2025)
* **QuantumBlur algorithm**: [https://github.com/qiskit-community/QuantumBlur](https://github.com/qiskit-community/QuantumBlur)

## Evaluation Criteria

* **Artistic merit / Creativity**
* **Clear use of quantum thinking**
* **Presentation of the final result**
* **Technical complexity**, though not a direct requirement, will be judged in the case of a tie.

## Submission

Your submission will contain a creative use of the algorithm and decoding, a short description of what you have done, and some source code.

Ideally, the source code should be re-runnable to generate your finished product, but if you want to integrate the output into a more complex pipeline with external tools, then this is of course, completely allowed.

Your submission should contain the following:

* Some source code
* Final artistic result (picture, video, music, etc.)
* A write-up describing what you did and how you did it
* **OPTIONALLY** a short video demo and presentation
