# 3D Location Estimation Using RSSI of Wireless LAN


## Introduction
## Description

### Problem Statement:
This challenge aims to develop an AI/ML-based localization algorithm/technique that can accurately estimate the position of a receiver based on RSS information obtained from the surrounding radio transmitters. Different from the prior year challenge, height information is included in the dataset and the objective is to estimate the 3D location of the target.
The developed localization algorithm/technique needs to estimate the position of the receiver given (i) RSS information from transmitters whose positions are known in advance, (ii) information about the surrounding buildings such as RSSI measured with time stamp and SSID, time-series GPS data (Latitude and Longitude) of the transmitter, channel setting, and map information of the measurement area to analyze LoS/NLoS condition in each wireless communication link.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

1. Average localization error D ̅ [m], which is defined as RMSE(root-mean-square error) of localization.
2. Maximum localization error [m], which is the maximum value among all the localization errors calculated using Equation (1).
3. Algorithm performance (computational complexity, required memory size, scalability, etc),
4. Future direction of improving the proposed algorithm/technique.
