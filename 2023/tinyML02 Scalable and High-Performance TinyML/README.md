# PS-002 - Fault Impact Analysis: Towards Service-Oriented Network Operation & Maintenance

## Introduction
## Description
<u>Introduction</u>

The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in resource-constrained devices has ushered in a new era of innovative solutions for various real-world challenges. One such domain is the application of tinyML in agriculture, which has the potential to revolutionize the way we monitor and manage these critical resources. In this competition, participants are invited to create scalable and high-performance tinyML solutions utilizing open datasets, specifically focusing on plant disease detection.

<u>Plant Disease Detection</u>:

The plant disease dataset comprises images of multiple plant species exhibiting signs of diseases, pests, or nutrient deficiencies. Participants are required to develop tinyML models that can not only accurately classify these plant diseases but also ensure scalability to accommodate a wide range of species and conditions. The solutions should provide actionable insights for farmers and agricultural experts, aiding in the prevention and management of plant diseases.

<u>Problem statement</u>:
The goal of this challenge is to create a low-cost, low-power, reliable, accurate, solutions. The developed tinyML solutions should be optimized for deployment on resource-constrained devices, such as microcontrollers, edge devices, or IoT sensors, with minimal power consumption and low latency. Additionally, the models should be designed with scalability (in terms of performance and functionality) in mind, allowing for seamless integration into broader ecosystems and the potential to expand their capabilities.
By successfully addressing this challenge, participants will play a vital role in the development of scalable and high-performance tinyML solutions that can revolutionize agriculture, ultimately promoting sustainable practices and preserving our planet’s precious resources.
