# Title Extraction in Lecture Slides Challenge by ITU AI/ML in 5G Challenge

## Can you identify titles in presentation slides?

Link to Zindi: https://zindi.africa/competitions/title-extraction-in-lecture-slides-challenge

YouTube’s “Video Chapter” feature segments a video into sections marked by timestamps so that the user can easily navigate to the part of the video which is of most interest. This can be done by clicking or pressing the chapter marker, or by selecting the timestamp in the video description.

In this problem statement we want to take this feature further. In webinars where speakers present slides, participants of the problem statement are asked to create the best AI model which annotates slides by identifying (apparent) titles in frames extracted from presentations.

Recordings of 100 “AI for Good” webinars were sourced to assemble a diverse collection of more than 140 video presentations made by members of the scientific community, entrepreneurs, and standardization experts. These were then segmented into frames containing the slides with titles.

An automated slide annotation in videos will improve accessibility of lecture-like content and enable better analytics.

### Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this challenge is Word Error Rate Metric.

You can read more about WER in this [medium article](https://medium.com/@bethworthy/what-is-word-error-rate-measuring-the-wer-of-machine-generated-transcripts-and-its-limitations-1457be914f3b). Here are some [libraries](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) to start off with.

For every row in the dataset, submission files should contain 2 columns: ID and transcription.

Your submission file should look like this:

| ID | Title1                                                                 |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0  | New robot technologies improve worker safety                          |
| 1  | 11% of manually driven forklifts will be involved in incidents with injury likely |



### Prizes

There are 3 000 Zindi points available. You can read more about Zindi points [here](https://zindi.africa/discussions/13959?utm_source=zindi&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=challenge_resources&utm_id=CR).

Winners will be invited to collaborate on a paper.


Participants are required to submit:

1. A CSV file containing model predictions (online leaderboard);
2. The developed model code;
3. A report explaining their solution, including the outcomes of their models. The technical report will be used to judge the novelty/originality and usefulness of the proposed methodology
4. Participants will be required to present their solutions to an ITU Challenge Finale session

In evaluating the final submission, both the quality of the report (weighted 40%) and the achieved model score (weighted 60%) will be considered.

### Timeline

Competition closes on 11 June 2023.

Final submissions must be received by 11:59 PM GMT.

We reserve the right to update the contest timeline if necessary.


### Rules

This challenge is open to all.

#### Teams and collaboration

You may participate in challenges as an individual or in a team of up to four people. When creating a team, the team must have a total submission count less than or equal to the maximum allowable submissions as of the formation date. A team will be allowed the maximum number of submissions for the challenge, minus the total number of submissions among team members at team formation. Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Multiple accounts per user are not permitted, and neither is collaboration or membership across multiple teams. Individuals and their submissions originating from multiple accounts will be immediately disqualified from the platform.

Code must not be shared privately outside of a team. Any code that is shared, must be made available to all challenge participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).

The Zindi data scientist who sets up a team is the default Team Leader but they can transfer leadership to another data scientist on the team. The Team Leader can invite other data scientists to their team. Invited data scientists can accept or reject invitations. Until a second data scientist accepts an invitation to join a team, the data scientist who initiated a team remains an individual on the leaderboard. No additional members may be added to teams within the final 5 days of the challenge or last hour of a hackathon.

The team leader can initiate a merge with another team. Only the team leader of the second team can accept the invite. The default team leader is the leader from the team who initiated the invite. Teams can only merge if the total number of members is less than or equal to the maximum team size of the challenge.

A team can be disbanded if it has not yet made a submission. Once a submission is made individual members cannot leave the team.

All members in the team receive points associated with their ranking in the challenge and there is no split or division of the points between team members.

#### Datasets and packages

The solution must use publicly-available, open-source packages only.

You may use only the datasets provided for this challenge.

You may use pretrained models as long as they are openly available to everyone.

Automated machine learning tools such as automl are not permitted.

If the error metric requires probabilities to be submitted, do not set thresholds (or round your probabilities) to improve your place on the leaderboard. In order to ensure that the client receives the best solution Zindi will need the raw probabilities. This will allow the clients to set thresholds to their own needs.

You are allowed to access, use and share challenge data for any commercial, non-commercial, research or education purposes, under a CC-BY SA 4.0 license.

You must notify Zindi immediately upon learning of any unauthorised transmission of or unauthorised access to the challenge data, and work with Zindi to rectify any unauthorised transmission or access.

Your solution must not infringe the rights of any third party and you must be legally entitled to assign ownership of all rights of copyright in and to the winning solution code to Zindi.

#### Submissions and winning

You may make a maximum of 10 submissions per day.

You may make a maximum of 300 submissions for this challenge.

Before the end of the challenge you need to choose 2 submissions to be judged on for the private leaderboard. If you do not make a selection your 2 best public leaderboard submissions will be used to score on the private leaderboard.

During the challenge, your best public score will be displayed regardless of the submissions you have selected. When the challenge closes your best private score out of the 2 selected submissions will be displayed.

Zindi maintains a public leaderboard and a private leaderboard for each challenge. The Public Leaderboard includes approximately 30% of the test dataset. While the challenge is open, the Public Leaderboard will rank the submitted solutions by the accuracy score they achieve. Upon close of the challenge, the Private Leaderboard, which covers the other 70% of the test dataset, will be made public and will constitute the final ranking for the challenge.

Note that to count, your submission must first pass processing. If your submission fails during the processing step, it will not be counted and not receive a score; nor will it count against your daily submission limit. If you encounter problems with your submission file, your best course of action is to ask for advice on the challenge page.

If you are in the top 10 at the time the leaderboard closes, we will email you to request your code. On receipt of email, you will have 48 hours to respond and submit your code following the Reproducibility of submitted code guidelines detailed below. Failure to respond will result in disqualification.

If your solution places 1st, 2nd, or 3rd on the final leaderboard, you will be required to submit your winning solution code to us for verification, and you thereby agree to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.

If two solutions earn identical scores on the leaderboard, the tiebreaker will be the date and time in which the submission was made (the earlier solution will win).

The winners will be paid via bank transfer, PayPal if payment is less than or equivalent to $100, or other international money transfer platform. International transfer fees will be deducted from the total prize amount, unless the prize money is under $500, in which case the international transfer fees will be covered by Zindi. In all cases, the winners are responsible for any other fees applied by their own bank or other institution for receiving the prize money. All taxes imposed on prizes are the sole responsibility of the winners. The top winners or team leaders will be required to present Zindi with proof of identification, proof of residence and a letter from your bank confirming your banking details. Winners will be paid in USD or the currency of the challenge. If your account cannot receive US Dollars or the currency of the challenge then your bank will need to provide proof of this and Zindi will try to accommodate this.

Please note that due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, we are not currently able to make prize payments to winners located in Russia. We apologise for any inconvenience that may cause, and will handle any issues that arise on a case-by-case basis.

Payment will be made after code review and sealing the leaderboard.

You acknowledge and agree that Zindi may, without any obligation to do so, remove or disqualify an individual, team, or account if Zindi believes that such individual, team, or account is in violation of these rules. Entry into this challenge constitutes your acceptance of these official challenge rules.

Zindi is committed to providing solutions of value to our clients and partners. To this end, we reserve the right to disqualify your submission on the grounds of usability or value. This includes but is not limited to the use of data leaks or any other practices that we deem to compromise the inherent value of your solution.

Zindi also reserves the right to disqualify you and/or your submissions from any challenge if we believe that you violated the rules or violated the spirit of the challenge or the platform in any other way. The disqualifications are irrespective of your position on the leaderboard and completely at the discretion of Zindi.

Please refer to the FAQs and Terms of Use for additional rules that may apply to this challenge. We reserve the right to update these rules at any time.

#### Reproducibility of submitted code

If your submitted code does not reproduce your score on the leaderboard, we reserve the right to adjust your rank to the score generated by the code you submitted.

If your code does not run you will be dropped from the top 10. Please make sure your code runs before submitting your solution.

Always set the seed. Rerunning your model should always place you at the same position on the leaderboard. When running your solution, if randomness shifts you down the leaderboard we reserve the right to adjust your rank to the closest score that your submission reproduces.

Custom packages in your submission will not be accepted.

All data manipulation must be done in code, manual manipulation via manual labelling or Excel will lead to disqualification.

You may only use tools available to everyone i.e. no paid services or free trials that require a credit card.
