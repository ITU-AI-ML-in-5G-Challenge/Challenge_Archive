# PS-002 - Fault Impact Analysis: Towards Service-Oriented Network Operation & Maintenance

## Introduction
## Description
<u>Introduction</u>

Introduction
The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in resource-constrained devices has ushered in a new era of innovative solutions for various real-world challenges. One such domain is the application of tinyML in wildlife conservation, which has the potential to revolutionize the way we monitor and manage these critical resources. In this competition, participants are invited to create scalable and high-performance tinyML solutions utilizing open datasets focusing on wildlife monitoring.

**Wildlife Monitoring**
The camera trap dataset contains images captured in natural habitats, featuring diverse wildlife species and their activities. Participants must design tinyML models that can effectively identify and classify animals in these images while maintaining the ability to scale across different environments and species. These solutions will contribute to wildlife monitoring and conservation initiatives.

**Problem statement**
The goal of this challenge is to create a low-cost, low-power, reliable, accurate, solutions. The developed tinyML solutions should be optimized for deployment on resource-constrained devices, such as microcontrollers, edge devices, or IoT sensors, with minimal power consumption and low latency. Additionally, the models should be designed with scalability (in terms of performance and functionality) in mind, allowing for seamless integration into broader ecosystems and the potential to expand their capabilities.
By successfully addressing this challenge, participants will play a vital role in the development of scalable and high-performance tinyML solutions that can transform wildlife conservation, thereby promoting sustainable practices and preserving our planet’s precious resources.
