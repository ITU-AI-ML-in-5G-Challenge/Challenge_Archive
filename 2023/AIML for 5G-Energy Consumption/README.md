# PS-002 - Fault Impact Analysis: Towards Service-Oriented Network Operation & Maintenance

## Introduction
## Description
#### **Background**

The goal of fault management in telecom O&M (Operation & Maintenance) is to ensure stable & reliable networks and services. In the RAN (Radio Access Network), the most significant part of O&M activities is network fault management, including fault monitoring, analysis, diagnosis, and repair processes. Among these processes, fault analysis is an essential part of troubleshooting.

In the current practices with large-scale and complex network structure, O&M engineers have to face massive faults & alarms in daily work. The traditional way to analyze faults is by setting rules based on network experts’ experience, such as duration of faults or predefined categories of faults, to determine which faults need to be handled with higher priority.

However, with the traditional method, the impact of each fault on network KPIs (Key Performance Indicator), such as coverage and data rate, are not explicitly assessed and taken into consideration. As a result, the reliability of network service cannot be quantified and it is impossible to optimally schedule O&M resources. For example, even if some faults are so critical that NEs (Network Elements) are out of service because of them, they might not be urgent and could still be handled with lower priority. More precisely, consider a heterogeneous network where several NEs provide multiple layers of coverage (e.g., the co-existence of 4G and 5G, multiple frequency bands). In this case, even if a NE is out of service due to a sudden fault, there might not be coverage hole since users may migrate to neighboring NEs to access the network and obtain the same level of service quality. Therefore, the fault can be handled with low priority if other faults with worse impacts exist. In another case as stated in what follows, some faults need to be prioritized although they might only cause service capability deterioration of a NE rather than a service outage. When this kind of fault occurs, users can still access the network through the NE, but with a dropped service quality, which may lead to complaints and subscriber churn.

#### **<u>Problem statement</u>**

In order to better guide fault management and optimally allocate limited O&M resources, this problem is targeting at leveraging ML/AI to predict the impact of faults on RAN KPIs. This is a critical capability for the autonomy of next-generation communications systems. It will empower the state-of-the-art fault management to upgrade from fixing network devices to fixing network service quality, and eventually drive network O&M transformation from equipment-centric to service-centric.

As described in the above examples, the impact of fault on RAN KPIs depend on network topology, NE’s historical and current running state and when & where the fault occurs. In the challenge, the participants are asked to develop a machine learning-based model to predict how each NE’s average data rate changes when a fault occurs based on network topology and historical data.

#### **Challenges**

- Uncertainty and non-stationarity in fault impact:
The stochastic feature of RAN, including radio propagation, user mobility, and traffic demand, can result in instability, fluctuation, and non-stationarity in RAN KPI data. It can be hard to determine whether a RAN KPI anomaly is caused by fault or fluctuation.
- Complexity of RAN networking and mechanism
RAN is a highly complex system where RAN KPIs are correlated with multiple aspects. For instance, different networking topology and configurations of RAN lead to diverse coupling effects among NEs. The impact of a fault depends on ongoing NE configuration, peripheral networking, and running status. Different fault types’ mechanisms vary greatly and are intricate. Therefore, there is no straightforward way to identify the impact of a fault.
- Uncertainty contributed by customer segmentations
Additionally, stochasticity and uncertainty on the RAN KPIs are due to the distinct user behaviors and requirements, which vary in time and space
- Uncertainty generated by non-RAN’s fault e.g. flashing transmission issues, devices, and applications
The RAN is a convoluted network where fluctuations of KPIs can also be generated by non-RAN’s faults. However, these faults and their relation with RAN KPIs are complex to model.



### Evaluation criteria

Participants will submit a report (in journal paper format) explaining their modelling solution, including the outcomes of their models on the testset.
In the dataset, there are K *.csv files where each file relates to a NE under a certain fault occurrence within a duration of N_k hours. For each file, the status of data rate change of the NE within each fault’s duration hours needs to be predicted by the model.
Specifically, the status of data rate change is defined as whether the value of data rate being less than the value right before the fault. If so, the state is labelled as ‘1’, otherwise, the state is labelled as ‘0’.

F1-score will be used to evaluate the performance of the model:

$$
\text{F1-Score} = \frac{2*(Precision*recall)}{Precision + Recall}
$$

Let us denote as TP and FP the numbers of true positive results and false positive results, respectively. Then, the Precision and Recall metrics are defined as follows:

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
$$

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
$$

## **Data source**

A dataset with RAN KPI data, collected from over 100 5G and 4G NEs, will be provided to train machine-learning models. For each NE in the network, it provides 7 key KPIs, the duration of a fault, and the “distance” of the NE to the fault in an hourly basis. Specifically, each row includes:
- NE ID, which is a unique identifier for each NE;
- Hourly timestamp of the data;
- 6 RAN KPIs that is related to data rate, including Access Success Rate, Resource Utilizing Rate, TA (Time Advanced), BLER (Block Error Rate), CQI (Channel Quality Indicator), MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme);
- Data rate of the hour;
- Fault duration (in seconds) during the hour.
- “Distance” (Relation) of the NE to the fault, where

a) If the value is 0, it means that there is no fault during the hour;
b) If the value is 1, it means that the fault occurred exactly at the NE;
c) If the value is between 0 and 1, it means that the fault occurred at a neighboring NE, and that a larger value indicates a higher adjacency between the 2 NEs.
Specifically, for the submitted model, its input and output are:
- Input:

a) Data rate and other features collected before the fault occurs, where fault duration is 0;
b) fault duration and relation in the first hour during which the fault appears, i.e., the fault duration is larger than 0;
- Output:

a) Status of data rate in the first hour during which the fault appears, i.e., the fault duration is larger than 0.
Here are 3 examples of the dataset:

1. For NE 213172-1, the fault occurred exactly at the NE from 2022-12-6 18:00 to 2022-12-6 19:00

2. For NE 211172-1, the fault occurred at a neighboring NE from 2022-12-6 8:00 to 2022-12-6 10:00, and the adjacency between the 2 NEs is relatively high.

3. For NE 211182-2, the fault occurred at a neighboring NE at 2022-12-7 0:00, and the adjacency between the 2 NEs is relatively low.

## **Resources**
To reduce the need for wireless knowledge, participants will be provided with domain knowledge references about wireless communications.
This reference takes the form of a knowledge graph that illustrates the relation of KPIs with occurrence of faults.
The root node of the graph represents the fault, while the other nodes represent the network KPIs. An edge in the graph indicates a conditional relationship between the two nodes, and the direction of the edge indicates that changes in the upper-level node might cause changes in the lower-level node.
